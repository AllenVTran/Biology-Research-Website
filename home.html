		<h1>Rubella: A Virus Microbe</h1>

		<h2> Rubella Characterisitics </h2>
		<p>	Having a virus is almost unbelievable to cope with. One with pain-sickening symptoms that it can ruin your day. <i>Rubella</i>, a virus microbe, has been found centuries in the making causing epidemic spreads. Its known virus is called German measles. Made up of single-stranded RNA, it can deal severe torture to the host.<p>
		<p><i>Rubella</i> has some unique characterisitics of its own such as a cell, but less complicated. It's size and structure are unique itself with its spherical shape made of glycoproteins, lipid bilayer proteins, and icosahedral that is in one capsid. Inside the capsid, there is a positive sense, single-stranded RNA. The typical virus is actually smaller than human cells with a 50-70 nm diameter. The shape of a typical rubivirus is a sphere, but the parts of are shaped with sphered and pentagons.</p>

		<h2> Eukaryotic Cell V.S. Rubella</h2>
		<p>Between a cell and a virus, there are many differences as well as similarities. The virus could be explained as what its made of compared to the host cell, or vice versa. How they both function, or how they change. How they live, or simply how they are portrayed. Here are a few that I could list:</p>
		<p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0;">Differences:</p>
		<ol>
			<li><i>Rubella</i> has the genomes of both DNA and RNA.</li>
			<li>Eukaryotic cells uses/obtain energy.</li>
			<li><i>Rubella</i> is made of single-stranded RNA with a positive sense ( acts as an mRNA and makes proteins in host cell).</li>
			<li>Eukaryotic cells have different organelles such as the nucleus.</li>
			<li>Eukaryotic responds to environemental changes such as growth.</li>
			<li><i>Rubella</i> has to infect cell to multiply while a eukaryotic is a part of the host.</li>
		</ol>
		<p style="text-align:left;text-indent:0;">Similarities:</p>
		<ol>
			<li>Both the host cell and <i>Rubella</i> reproduce and replicate.</li>
			<li>Virus goes and infects the host cell which is by itself. Virus depends on host to multiply and spread.</li>
			<li>Both have a genomic DNA.</li>
			<li>Both changes over time with host cell growing while virus is multiplying.</li>
			<li>Shaped as a sphere that holds some genome.</li>
		</ol>
